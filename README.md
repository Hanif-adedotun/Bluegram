# Bluegram
Bluegram is a no-code android application built entirely on a mobile phone, it is a blutooth messaging app that allows users to send messages to each other without using mobile data, as long as they are within the Bluetooth connection range. It was to eliminate the need of mobile data to chat with people in the same building.
